In the above visualization, we can see that Subscribers tend to use the bikes far more than customers. We can also see that bikes are predominantly used by Male Subscribers. 

## Summary
From our analysis, we now know that the predominant use of the bikes is by male subscribers going to and from work in Manhattan. This implies that Citi Bike is a popular way to get to work. 
It would be beneficial to compare the popularity of bike rides in February to bike rides in October to see how the weather affects the amount of people using the bikes to get to work. 
It would also be beneficial to create a visualization to the location of starting locations to subway locations to see if commuters are using the bike share out of convenience because they are not near a subway or preference.
